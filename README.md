# Student-Grade-Generator-Toy-Problem
This is a Student Grade Generator that prompts the user to input student marks. 
The input is between 0 and 100 whicch stands as the minimum and maximum score every students can score. 
Then the output of the respetive grade is given below:
A > 79, 
B - 60 to 79, 
C -  59 to 49, 
D - 40 to 49, 
E - less 40.
I used Javascript to wire down the solution.
